# 🛡️ Sentinel Protocol

We are building **Sentinel Protocol** — a parametric insurance framework for any risk market with reliable oracles, using **Soroban smart contracts** to enable automated claims, transparency, and full decentralization.

Our first iteration runs oracles inside **Acurast Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** to securely fetch and forward Web2 data (e.g. wildfire, flight delays) to the blockchain in a **trust-minimized** way.

We're also building a 💰 **Vault standard on Soroban**, inspired by **ERC-4626** from the EVM ecosystem, to manage capital flow between **Hedge Vaults** (protection buyers) and **Risk Vaults** (risk-takers providing liquidity).
